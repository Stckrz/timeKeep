# TimeKeep Time Tracker

## What It I:
This app is a time keeping tool for handling sprints, or small bits of time recorded consecutively, and returning a consolidated time block indicative of the time spent.
This is especially useful when the user has to log time for work, but is only payed for the time actually completing tasks. This way, instead of logging dozens of short
time windows, they can consolidate all of the shorter sprints in to one adjusted time block.

## How To Use:
Simply click start to begin a sprint, and stop to finish the sprint. Hit cancel if you no longer want the currently counting sprint. In the bottom right, you can see the adjusted total time, and the associated time block. Hit clear to remove all time blocks when finished.

## How It Works:
This is a simple front-end web application that uses local storage to keep track of sprints. All of the data is stored on the user's end. There are no cookies, no databases, and no shared/stored data.
